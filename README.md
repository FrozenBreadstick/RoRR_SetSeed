# To Do:
- Menu for setting seed (If you want to change the seed currently, edit the "local seed" variable at the top of the main.lua file in the mod folder)
- Fix director spawns by implementing a random number calculation that changes with each spawn.
- Fix shrines. Either do not work and give no items or work without fail but give two items of the same rarity in a row (Drone scrappers too)
- Bosses killed need to multiply or add by number of bosses killed this stage so that each boss drops a different item.
- Naturally spawned boss enemy and scavs are unseeded
- Drifter is unseeded

#### THIS MOD IMPLEMENTS CUSTOM SEED LOGIC DUE TO DIFFICULTIES WITH THE GAMES INTERNAL LOGIC, NORMAL RUNS WILL NOT HAVE A CORRESPONDING SEED FROM THIS MOD
